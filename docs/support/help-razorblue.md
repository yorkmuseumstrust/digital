# Making an effective support request

You can help IT Support understand, prioritise and resolve your issue, by providing more detail in your support request.

This will get you back up and running faster! 🏃‍♂️

On this page you will find some tips for making a great support request.

## What to include:

### 1. Be as specific as possible.
- Describe your IT issue in your own words. 🤔 💭
- Is something not working as it should?
- Or do you need a change to a system, such as creating a new user account?
- The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to help you.

### 2. Describe your issue in detail.
- Give a clear summary of the issue and more detail in the main message.
- Any details help IT Support understand the issue and address it more quickly.
- Include:
	- any error messages that have popped up
	- any steps that you've tried to resolve the problem
	- any other relevant information

### 3. Provide screenshots or screen recordings, if possible.
Visual aids are one of the best ways to help IT Support understand the issue quickly.

Here's how to do it:

**To capture all screens:**
Press **prtsc/F10** (print screen). This will save an image of your entire screen (or both screens) to the clipboard.

**To capture just the active window:**
Press **Alt** + **prtsc/F10**. This will save an image of the window you are currently using.

Next, open an email or document and press **ctrl+v** to paste your image into it. You can then send the email or upload the document as an attachment.

### 4. Say how the issue is affecting your and others' work.
- Does it affect you alone?
- Does it affect two or more users, or the whole organisation?
- Does it prevent work partly or completely?

### 5. Give your contact details (name, department, phone, email address).
- If possible, provide a phone number. 📲
- IT Support can help you best when they can talk to you about the issue.
- If the issue affects more than one person, say who the best person is to contact.

### 6. Say when you are available to receive IT support.
- Tell IT Support when you're available. 💁🏾‍♂️
- Don't feel obliged to respond outside of your working hours, if it's not convenient.
- Be prepared to give IT Support remote access to your device when they get in touch.
