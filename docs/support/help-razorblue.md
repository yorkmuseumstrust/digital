# Making an effective support request

Providing the best support request that you can helps Razorblue understand, prioritise and resolve your issue.

This will get you back up and running faster! 🏃‍♂️

Here are some tips for making a great support request.

## What to include:

### 1. Be as specific as possible.
- Describe your IT issue in your own words. 🤔 💭
- Is something not working as it should?
- Or do you need a change to a system, such as creating a new user account?
- The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to help you.

### 2. Describe your issue in detail.
- Give a clear summary of the issue and more detail in the main message.
- Any details help Razorblue understand the issue and address it more quickly.
- Include:
	- any error messages that have popped up
	- any steps that you've tried to resolve the problem
	- any other relevant information

### 3. Provide screenshots or screen recordings, if possible.
Visual aids are one of the best ways to help Razorblue understand the issue quickly.

Here's how to do it:

**To capture all screens:**
You can do this by pressing **ctrl+v** to print screen. This will save an image of your entire screen (or both screens) to the clipboard.

**To capture just the active window:**
You can do this by pressing **Alt** + **prtsc/F10**. This will save an image of the window you are currently using.

You can then open an email or document and press **ctrl+v** to paste your image into it.

### 4. Say how the issue is affecting your and others' work.
- Does it affect you alone?
- Does it affect two or more users, or the whole organisation?
- Does it prevent work partly or completely?

### 5. Give your contact details (name, department, phone, email address).
- If possible, provide a phone number. 📲
- Razorblue can help you best when they can talk to you about the issue.
- If the issue affects more than one person, say who the best person is to contact.

### 6. Say when you are available to receive IT support.
- Tell Razorblue when you're available. 💁🏾‍♂️
- Don't feel obliged to respond outside of your working hours, if it's not convenient.
- Be prepared to give Razorblue remote access to your device when they get in touch.
