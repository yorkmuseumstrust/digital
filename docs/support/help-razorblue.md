# Help Razorblue to support you

Providing the best support request that you can helps Razorblue to support you more effectively and efficiently.

They will be more able to understand, prioritise and resolve your issue.

This will get you back up and running faster! 🏃‍♂️

Here's some guidance on how to make a support request.

## What to include in your support request:

### 1. Be as specific as possible.
Describe your IT issue in your own words. 🤔 💭
Is it an incident, such as a software issue or a hardware malfunction?
Or is it a change, such as creating a new user account?
The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to help you.
> My laptop screen has gone blank and it will not restart.

### 2. Describe your issue in detail.
Put a clear summary of the issue in your message header and give more detail in the main message.
Include:
- any error messages that have popped up
- any steps you've already tried to resolve the problem
- any other relevant information
This helps Razorblue understand the issue and address it more quickly.

### 3. If possible, provide screenshots or screen recordings.
Visual aids are incredibly helpful to help Razorblue understand the issue quickly.

### 4. State how the issue is affecting your work.
Does your issue:
- Affect you alone?
- Affect two or more users, or the whole organisation?
- Prevent work partly or completely?
Tell Razorblue clearly how your or others' work is affected.

### 5. Make sure you provide your name, department and contact details (phone and email). 📲
If the issue affects more than one person, be specific about who the best person is to contact as soon as possible.

### 6. Say when you are available to receive IT support, including giving remote access to your device. 💁🏾‍♂️
Tell them when you're available, and don't feel obliged to respond outisde of your working hours if it's not convenient.
