# How Razorblue prioritise support requests

Razorblue use industry-standard methods to categorise and prioritise IT support requests.

But, don't worry! You don't need to categorise or prioritise your issue for Razorblue. You just need to tell them what is happening for you.

This page is just for information, if you want to know more about the process.

### An incident or a change

An IT support request will be either:

- **an incident:** this includes any situation where an IT device or system fails to function as intended

or:

- **a change:** this includes adding, modifying or removing anything that might affect the IT service

Razorblue can support you with any IT issue which is either **an incident** or **a change**.


### Priority levels 
Razorblue use the following descriptions to sort and prioritise support requests, whether they are incidents or changes.

**Incidents**

**P1 incident:** total systems outage affecting whole business or platform

**P2 incident:** partial systems outage or intermittent fault affecting a group of users

**P3 incident:** issue preventing an individual from working

**P4 incident:** minor issue or annoyance affecting an individual or group

> We know that a minor issue may be vitally important to you, but will be a lower priority in the system overall.
Razorblue will try to get to your issue as fast as possible.


**Changes**

**RFC1 simple change:** one which takes less than 15 minutes to complete, e.g. setting up a new user account

**RFC2 complex change:** one which takes more than 15 minutes to complete or affects more than one user

**RFC3 non-inclusive change:** one which is outside of the service contract terms and attracts an additional charge
