# How Razorblue will respond to your support request

### Expect a phone call ðŸ“²

Razorblue prefer to respond by phone.
Talking to you makes it much easier to identify the issue and to solve it.
They will respond by email if they don't have a phone number for you.

### Be prepared for them to take control of your device ðŸ’»

It's likely they will need to access your device and might need to shut it down while resolving the issue. 
It's wise to save and close your work before they access your device - or they might do it for you while accessing your device.
