# Should I contact YMT Digital or Razorblue?
For IT support, please contact Razorblue: [Support](support/)

For digital projects, please contact Digital: digital@ymt.org.uk

### Argh, it's not working!
For immediate support with an IT issue, you will get help fastest by contacting Razorblue.

Razorblue have over 170 people working for them who can collaborate to resolve your issue.

That's a lot of IT brainpower. 🧠

### Isn't that what Digital do?
Whilst YMT's Digital team is obviously brilliant and exceptionally hardworking 😇, we have just 3.4 people (yes, really!). 

None of them are directly tasked with resolving IT support issues. See what we do in [About](about/)

We contract Razorblue to support you with day-to-day IT issues - so please use them, otherwise it's like paying for a membership and not using it! 🏋️‍♂️

We pay them to support you - if we do it ourselves, we're paying twice. 💷 🙊

### But Razorblue will need to talk to Digital anyway ...
Maybe, but there is a lot Razorblue can help you with due to their access to our systems.

If Razorblue need to involve Digital, they will bring us in.

### I'm not sure Razorblue can help.
Let them work it out - they will tell you if it's not an issue they can resolve.

### I feel like I should let Digital know too ...
When you submit a support request to Razorblue, it's logged in the Razorblue call system which can be seen by both Razorblue and the Digital team.

By having all requests logged in one system, we can also review the data and identify patterns and needs that might require a different approach, such as training or a change of systems. If your requests don't enter the system, it's much harder to spot the trends. 📈

### So, I shouldn't contact Digital then ...? 🙁
We would really love to hear from you with digital ideas, or problems which might need a digital solution, and which would assist your team or benefit our museum users.

If you contact Digital with an immediate IT support issue, there could be a delay in getting you support. We may be occupied with projects which will help us all work better in the long-term or deliver content for our audiences.

(Or we might be in a long meeting 🤔 - while Razorblue are just waiting on your call! 📳)

### Then, what do Digital do?!
Digital enable a wide range of digital development projects across YMT, and are also developing new ways of supporting you with your own digital development in the workplace.
