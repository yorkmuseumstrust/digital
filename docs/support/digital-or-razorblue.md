# Should I contact YMT Digital or Razorblue?
For IT support, please contact Razorblue: [Support](support/)

For digital projects, please contact Digital: digital@ymt.org.uk

### Argh, it's not working!
- For immediate support with an IT issue, you will get help fastest by contacting Razorblue.

- Razorblue have over 170 people working for them who can collaborate to resolve your issue.

- ... That's a lot of IT brainpower! üß†

### Isn't that what Digital do?
- Whilst our Digital team is, of course, brilliant and exceptionally hardworking üòá, we are just 3.4 people - and no one is directly tasked with resolving IT support issues.

- That's why we contract Razorblue to support you with day-to-day IT issues.

- If your YMT Digital colleagues do the work for Razorblue, then YMT will be paying us and them to do the same job! üí∑ üôä

### But Razorblue will need to talk to Digital anyway ...
- Maybe, but there is a lot Razorblue can help you with directly due to their access to our systems.

- If Razorblue need to involve Digital, they will bring us in.

### I'm not sure Razorblue can help.
- Let them work it out - they will tell you if it's not an issue they can resolve.

### I feel like I should let Digital know too ...
- When you submit a support request to Razorblue, it's logged in the Razorblue call system which can be seen by both Razorblue and the Digital team.

- By having all requests logged in one system, we can review the data and identify patterns and needs that might require a different approach, such as training or a change of systems.

- If your requests don't enter the system, it's much harder to spot any trends. üìà

### So, I shouldn't contact Digital then ...? üôÅ
- We would really love to hear from you with digital ideas, or problems which might need a digital solution, and which would assist your team or benefit our museum users. ü§©

- If you contact Digital with an immediate IT support issue, there could be a delay in getting you support.

- Razorblue are just waiting on your call, whilst we might be in a long (but wonderful!) meeting about a project which will help us all work better or deliver content for our audiences.


### Then, what do Digital do?!
- Digital enable a wide range of digital development projects across YMT.

- We are also developing new ways of supporting you with your own digital development in the workplace.
