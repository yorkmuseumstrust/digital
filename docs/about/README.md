# About

On this page you will find out about the **Digital and Data Team** ðŸ¦„ at York Museums Trust and how we understand digital.

## Digital is not just about technology.
 
## It's about making digital work for people, by putting to work the culture, processes, business models, and technologies of the digital age.

### We believe that only through harnessing the tools, techniques and technology of the digital age will we fulfil our charitable vision and outcomes.

The purpose of the **Digital and Data Team** ðŸ¦„ is to guide this digital adoption, and accelerate our journey to become a digitally mature organisation which puts users first.
