# About.

On this page you will find out about **Digital** and the **Digital and Data Team** ðŸ¦„ at York Museums Trust.

## Digital is not just about technology. Its about putting the culture, processes, business models, and technologies of the digital age to work for people.

### We believe that only through harnessing the tools, techniques and technology of the digital age will we fulfil our charitable vision and outcomes.

The purpose of the **Digital and Data Team** ðŸ¦„ is to guide this adoption and accelerate our journey to become a digitally mature and user-centred organisation.

Our principal values are to embrace **curiosity**, **creativity**, **generosity**, and **responsibility** equally and together. For example, in the Digital and Data Team this means:

- curiosity drives the team to explore new ideas, technologies, and approaches to engage the audience effectively.
- team's commitment to fostering creativity by encouraging innovative thinking and experimentation.
-  generosity plays a role in sharing knowledge, resources, and experiences with the community
- team's responsibility in ensuring ethical and inclusive digital practices, respecting privacy, and promoting digital literacy
